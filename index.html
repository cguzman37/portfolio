                    <p> My name is Cynthia Guzman. I decided to take a coding bootcamp since I wanted a career change. I realized healthcare wasn't a great fit for me and wanted to change into something I've always been curious about. I enjoy playing video games like APEX or Fortnite. I also love binge watching Netflix. If you have any show recommendations, please let me know!
